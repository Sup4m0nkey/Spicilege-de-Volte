#### Chorus :  
I thought I believed her  
When she told me we were a team  
We would be forever  
Cause I love her to the extreme

Look at me, in the eye  
And tell me everything and more  
I've never been so high  
My heart has never been so sore

You said that you loved me  
So I would stay here unafraid  
Now I must pay the fee  
But I know you won't leave my head

When I think about you  
My stomach dies a little more  
Nothing can pull me through  
If only I knew this before

You grew up and you changed  
And all this time I stayed the same  
This world that you arranged  
Why kill the beast that you can tame ?
