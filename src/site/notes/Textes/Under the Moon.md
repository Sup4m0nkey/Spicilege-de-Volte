In the forest I am running
The wind is breathing in my ears
Howling my joy I'm everything
I am a wolf I have no fears
I see the trees growing up there
Come with me jump across the mist
My friend, Nature, is everywhere
Under the Moon I now exist
The grass always brushes my breast
A nice feeling travels my skin
Those little strands tickling my chest
I love the Earth it's all I mean
I see the trees growing up there
Come with me jump across the mist
My friend, Nature, is everywhere
Under the Moon I now exist
I must confess this mystery
I am no more a human being
I'm a werewolf and I am free
Winter won't die, there's no Spring
I see the trees growing up there
Come with me jump across the mist
My friend, Nature, is everywhere
Under the Moon I now exist
I am not damned I'm a blessed one
Don't listen to those foolish men
It's good to be half wolf half man
I'm God's creature like you my friend
I see the trees growing up there
Come with me jump across the mist
My friend, Nature, is everywhere
Under the Moon I now exist
