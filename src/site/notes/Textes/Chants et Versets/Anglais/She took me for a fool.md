Chorus :
I thought I believed her
We could be as one forever
She took me for a fool
Used me as if I was a tool

Look at me in the eye
And tell me everything and more
I've never been so high
My heart has never been so sore
You said that you loved me
So I would stay here unafraid
Now I must pay the fee
But I know you won't leave my head
When I think about you
My stomach dies a little more
Nothing can pull me through
If only I knew this before
You grew up and you changed
And all this time I stayed the same
This world that you arranged
Why kill the beast that you can tame ?
